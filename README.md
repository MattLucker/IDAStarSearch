# IDAStarSearch
A fun project of mine to experiment with the IDA* search algorithm and finding solutions for a 2x2 Rubik's cube.


Instructions:

1. Run create_algs.py to generate a new set of algorithms in algs.txt.
  - create_algs.py 'length of algs' 'number of algs'

2. Run solver.py to return the solutions in solutions.txt and runtimes in times.txt.


The graphs included in /pics were generated from the files in /graphing,
which have yet to be adapted for ease of use but are representational
of the work provided.
